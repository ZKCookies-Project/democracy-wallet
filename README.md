# Democracy Wallet
A user-friendly, open-source, non-custodial wallet for the cypherpunk movement. Cypherpunks write code [1], and Democracy Wallet exists to get them paid. It is well-suited for the crypto-native, retroactive public goods funding community efforts. Please give it a try and share your feedback. Thanks in advance.
